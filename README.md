### Labo 1: GIT To Work ###

##### Challenge

<dl>
  <dd>We had to form a team of 3-4 people and make a mini website with cooking receipes to refresh our memory about CSS and HTML, basic things we've learned in a previous course. Learn to work with GIT and its features. Commit the project, and your invidivual work, to one directory.</dd>
</dl>
  
##### What I've Learned

<dl>
  <dd>In this lesson I had my first experience working with GIT. The syntax, the commands, the right workflow, etc. I've learned it's an easy way to share code with others and to analyse your own workflow. By being able to view all changes it's easy to fall back on a previous version of a project.</dd>
